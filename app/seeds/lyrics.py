        translation="Hiding deep, hiding deep in the forest, I know, lost among the trees\nAre the hearts that we simply left behind so many years ago\nHaving lost, having lost all our power to search, we lie completely drained\nAs our weary souls slowly fade away and darkness closes in\nOh, if we had just stayed forever young\nCould we find ourselves again, I wonder?\nEvery step we take, the more we seem to lose\nEvery waking breath, just a little more\nCaught up in the lies that hide between the lines\nNowhere left to run, nothing left to say\nNever stopping to gaze at the bluest of skies, the color starts to fade\nAnd itâ€™s changing with every passing day, our time is moving on\nIf we live for the moment and break all the walls we put up long ago\nOh, if we come to know the flow of time\nWill we fly up once again, I wonder?\nAs we move along, we live as wanderers\nLiving day to day, everywhere we go\nSearching for the light and trying to believe\nHere we are again, walking hand in hand\nEvery step we take, the more we seem to lose\nEvery waking breath, just a little more\nCaught up in the lies that hide between the lines\nNowhere left to run, nothing left to say\nAs we move along, we live as wanderers\nLiving day to day, everywhere we go\nTurning from the past, those roads we knew before\nWalking here with you, here forevermore\nNowhere left to run, nothing left to say\nLiving day to day, here forevermore"
